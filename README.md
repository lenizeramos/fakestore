# Mid Term - Fake Store

## Description

In this project, you will create a fake shop using OOP. You will create classes for each entity and use them to create the shop.

## Objectives

- Create one file per class and import where needed
- Show a list of products from an API, with image, title, price and description
- Be able to add products to the cart
- Show the total amount of the cart

## Instructions and Requirements

### Entities (classes)

- Cart
- CartItem
- CartItemList
- Header
- ProductItem
- ProductList
- Shop
- App
- and more as needed

> You can do differently if you think you can come up with better solution!!

### Step 1 - Review index.static.html and Watch Demo

Please reference [`index.static.html`](./index.static.html) and [DEMO](https://www.loom.com/share/26304f8a106b460e82dbe7707201b776?sid=13d15206-ca50-4342-bd39-c2d86978c408) to get familiar with UI.

> UI can be modified based but behavior **MUST** be working as expected!!

### Step 2 - Analyze the behavior

User should be able to

1. view the list of products that can be added to cart
2. view the Cart summary with total price
3. view either the list of items in the cart or placeholder when cart is empty
4. add item to the cart and increase quantity by pressing `Quick Add` button
5. remove item from cart and decrease quantity by pressing `Remove` button
6. view the Total Price gets updated as cart items change

### Step 3 - check the data structure

Please open [`server/db.json`](./server/db.json) and review the data structure

Alternatively, https://fakestoreapi.com/products

> Note: You will need to fetch data either way

### Step 4 - Review given Files

You may get many clues by scanning through the files. You are not required to use the existing codes. You are free to come up with your own.

### Step 5 - Start your midterm project

GOOD LUCK!!
